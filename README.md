-- Main_Manuscript_figures.nb
  Include all the calculations for generating the main manuscript figures

-- Supplementary_plots.nb
  This file includes the calculation for supplementary figure 2 (dynamics of the pump media) and figure 3 (eigenspectrum method for laser linewidth estimation).

-- Robustness_check.nb
  This file includes the calculation for the robustness of the ABOCC circuit design. It generates the figs. 5-9 in the Supplementary material.

-- ABOCC_eigenstates_and_Noise.nb
  This file includes the calculation for the eigenstates of the ABOCC operator. It generates the figs. 10-13 in the Supplementary material.
